# Part-II-Wireframe-Test
This is a test site for my wireframing on the immigration presentation


Here are the current wireframes for my data viz project: 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" data-type="interactive" data-title="Mapping Immigration "></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/ba8a1764-c0de-4bc3-8125-ba1d34f0f6cc" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Mapping Immigration </a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

## The following are questions for each user to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the graphics: 

a.	What story do you think these graphics are trying to convey? 
b.	Are these graphics interesting? Do they provoke any emotion or action?
c.  Are these graphics clear? 
d.	What did you like about them? 
e.	What did you dislike about them? 
f.	How, if applicable, would you change these graphics? 
g.	Is there any information you feel is unnecessary? 
h.	Is there any information you feel is missing? 
i.	Is there any information you feel is unclear or misleading?  
j.	On a scale of 1-10 how would you grade these graphics in creating a story? 
k.	How likely, if at all, are these graphics to motivate you to reach out to your political representatives surrounding the issue?
l.	Is there any additional feedback you would like to provide?

**Important to note that some graphs are currently missing information as they are just wireframing for the types of graphics I will create in the future, testing out specific color schemes, and making sure that the story would make sense if told in this fashion. 

## Why this project

There has been a lot of misinformation or #fakenews about immigration and immigrants inside of the United States over the past few years. I wanted to create a few graphics to describe the current trend of immigration levels into the united states as well as advocate for the increase in immigration. Hopefully these graphics demonstrate the amount of permanent residents accepted annually into the US.
